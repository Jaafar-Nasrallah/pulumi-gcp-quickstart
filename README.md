# üöÄ Infrastructure as Code Quickstart Repository üöÄ

Welcome to the Infrastructure as Code Quickstart repository! This repository provides a fast and efficient way to deploy and manage your infrastructure using **Pulumi**, an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool. With this quickstart, you can easily provision and manage multiple services and modules on various cloud providers.

## üíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your local machine:

- ‚úîÔ∏è [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for Python projects)
- ‚úîÔ∏è [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)

### Installation

To get started with the Infrastructure as Code Quickstart, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Next, you'll need to configure your cloud provider credentials and other settings:

1. **Cloud Provider Configuration**: Set up the necessary credentials for your cloud provider(s). Follow the official Pulumi documentation on [configuring your cloud provider](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/) credentials.

2. **Project Configuration**: Customize the settings in the `Pulumi.yaml` file to tailor the deployment to your specific needs. You can adjust variables such as region, instance sizes, and other service-specific configurations here.

## üöÄ Deploying the Infrastructure

To deploy the infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the Pulumi stack.

2. Set the appropriate cloud provider configuration using the `pulumi config` command.

3. Deploy the infrastructure.

Pulumi will now provision the specified services and modules according to your configuration.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

The repository's directory structure is organized to keep your code and configurations organized and maintainable. Here's an overview:

```
|-- infra
|   |-- stack1
|   |   |-- index.py
|   |-- stack2
|   |   |-- index.py
|-- modules
|   |-- module1
|   |   |-- index.py
|   |-- module2
|   |   |-- index.py
|-- Pulumi.yaml
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
|-- ...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing and Extending

You can easily customize and extend this quickstart repository to fit your specific infrastructure needs. Some ways to do this include:

- Adding or modifying existing Pulumi stacks for different environments (e.g., `prod`, `staging`).
- Integrating additional cloud services or modules into the existing stacks.
- Creating separate directories for each environment to keep configurations separate and organized.
